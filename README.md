NameTag is an open-source tool for named entity recognition (NER). NameTag
identifies proper names in text and classifies them into predefined categories,
such as names of persons, locations, organizations, etc. NameTag is distributed
as a standalone tool or a library, along with trained linguistic models. In the
Czech language, NameTag achieves state-of-the-art performance
([Strakov√° et al. 2013](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/papers/2013-tsd_ner.pdf)).
