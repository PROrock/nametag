NameTag is an open-source tool for named entity recognition (NER). NameTag
identifies proper names in text and classifies them into predefined categories,
such as names of persons, locations, organizations, etc. NameTag is distributed
as a standalone tool or a library, along with trained linguistic models. In the
Czech language, NameTag achieves state-of-the-art performance
([Strakov√° et al. 2013 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/papers/2013-tsd_ner.pdf]).
NameTag is a free software under [LGPL http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html]
license and the linguistic models are free for non-commercial use and

license, although for some models the original data used to create the model
may impose additional licensing conditions. NameTag is versioned using
